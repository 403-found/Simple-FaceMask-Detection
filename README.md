This is a COVID-19 face mask detection project developed using transfer learning. The model is based on MobileNet, with the last three layers modified to meet specific requirements. After 3-4 epochs, the model achieves approximately 96% accuracy. I hope it effectively fulfills its purpose. This model is designed for scalability, making it suitable for integration with cameras at workplaces and public transportation hubs.
